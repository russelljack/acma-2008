		Two Year Program (4 Semesters)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Parent and child participate together in this weekly, 50 minute class. Students learn to read music and play the piano in this comprehensive music course. Ear training skills are developed through singing, solfege (Do, Re, Mi syllables), and by-ear keyboard playing. In addition to learning notes and chords, music theory is reinforced through arranging, improvising, transposing and composing. Students play ensembles with other class members at the keyboard and on rhythm instruments. By the end of the first semester, students are playing hands together outside of the 5-finger range, and know 14 different notes. By the end of their 4th semester, students are playing in six different keys.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Students in the Piano Pals, Mighty Musicians, and Keyboard Kids classes are learning essentially the same concepts. However, older classes are able to move more quickly.
