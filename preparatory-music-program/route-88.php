		<p>
		All the benefits of our classes for younger children, but at a faster pace for teenagers and adults. Participants learn to read music and play the piano in this comprehensive music course. Ear training skills are developed through singing, solfege (Do, Re, Mi syllables), and by-ear keyboard playing. In addition to learning notes and chords, music theory is reinforced through arranging, improvising, transposing and composing.  Students play ensembles with other class members at the keyboard and on rhythm instruments. By the end of the first semester, students are playing hands together outside of the 5-finger range in four different keys, and know 23 notes. By the end of the course, students are playing in six different keys.
