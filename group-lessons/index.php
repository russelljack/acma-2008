		<h1>Group Lessons</h1>
		
		<p>
		Designed from the ground up for young children, the principles in our teaching system have been used successfully by millions of students across the world. Six specially-designed courses for six different age groups take advantage of where students are developmentally. Each fun-filled and learning-packed class incorporates activities that accomodate age-specific learning styles and attention spans. In addition to a keyboard for every child, rhythm instruments and many other learning tools provide variety and depth and prepare students for any instrument. Our program meets or exceeds all of the <a href="http://www.menc.org/resources/view/national-standards-for-music-education" target="_blank">National Standards for Music Education</a>. We are laying the foundation for a lifetime of musical enjoyment.
