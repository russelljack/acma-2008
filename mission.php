		<h1>Our Mission</h1>

		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	
		<p>
		We consider it a great privilege and responsibility to work with our students and base our work on the following principles and objectives:
		</p>
		<p>
		The knowledge, understanding and enjoyment of good music enhances the quality of life.
		</p>
		<p>
		Success in any field, and in life in general, is dependent on many of the skills learned and refined through the study of music. These skills include discipline, goal-setting, problem-solving, perseverance, performing under pressure and building a sense of self-worth. We are helping today's children become tomorrow's leaders.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Art City Music Academy is committed to providing a balanced and comprehensive musical education that will be valued and enjoyed throughout a lifetime. We are creating the ideal learning environment for our students and the ideal teaching environment for our instructors.
		</p>
		<p>
		We honor the dedication of parents to their children and admire those who provide for and support their musical training. We are committed to offering a superior program at an exceptional value.
		</p>
	
	 
		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<p>
		There is magic in music! It is one of the most enriching activities in which one can engage. It is extremely gratifying to enjoy and value one of the greatest arts known to man; to appreciate the labors of some of the greatest minds that ever lived. This alone would make it worthwhile, but it is only the beginning. The skills learned in the study of music are directly applicable to life. A short list of these skills would have to include discipline, concentration, problem-solving, creative and analytical thinking, performing under pressure and understanding the concept and value of delayed gratification. Every successful man or woman draws upon these and other skills to reach their full potential. As we like to say, some of life's most important lessons are learned on the bench...the piano bench that is. We are helping parents just like you prepare their children for super-success in life. There is no more important work than this and we take it very seriously.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
		In 1979 a 14 year old girl named Yvonne taught her first piano lesson. It didn't take her long to realize that this is what she wanted to do with her life and so her dream of opening a music school was born. Her excellent teacher took her under her wing and gave her lessons on the art of piano teaching in addition to regular piano lessons. She taught all through high school and continued while studying piano in college, first at UC Santa Barbara and then at Brigham Young University. When she graduated from BYU in 1987, she took her graduation money, made the down payment on a beautiful new grand piano and opened her school in Springville, Utah. In December of the same year, she married her husband, Chris, also a piano major at BYU. They have been working together ever since. Since its humble beginnings, the Art City Music Academy has grown from four students taught in the front room of a small rented house to over six hundred students in three locations. In spite of this wonderful growth, one thing has never changed: our commitment to providing our students with the best programs and opportunities so they can use and enjoy the many lifetime musical and non-musical benefits of music study.
