		<h1>Testimonials</h1>
		<p>
		In our 24 years of business, we've worked with some great families who have come to love us.  Here's what some of them have to say.
		</p>


		<div class="testimonial">
			<p>
			&ldquo;As a musician, I have long believed that the best preparation for children's musical study begins with developing a small child's ear. Since having my own children enrolled at the Art City Music Academy, I have been astounded at the quality of the curriculum. Observing the careful building blocks of ear training, rhythm work, singing, and keyboard application, I feel confident in the foundation my children are receiving. Best of all, I love how much my kids enjoy what they're learning; I hear them singing all the time--and in tune!&rdquo;

			&ldquo;As a professional musician...I recommend that children be involved with music from an early age, both for discipline and for self-esteem building. The Art City Music Academy is perfect because it requires no previous musical experience for either student or parent.&rdquo;
